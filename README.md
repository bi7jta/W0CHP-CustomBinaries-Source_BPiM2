# Description

Since I custom-compile and distribute third-party
[programs/binaries](https://repo.w0chp.net/Chipster/W0CHP-PiStar-bin) for
`W0CHP-PiStar-Dash`, I include all sources from upstream that are modified
(unlike other Pi-Star [and fork] devs).

I also include a crude build script that builds all of the binaries.
